        <h2>UPES is a dynamic community where you feel supported and encouraged. Regardless of where you come from, UPES is your home away from home</h2>
        
        <p>UPES has been bringing professionals from various industries into the classroom to share their insights, experiences, and knowledge with students. This approach aims to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application by providing students with a deeper understanding of how concepts are used in real business or industry contexts. At UPES School of Law, one of the important elements is to focus on clinical legal education, which involves learning the practical skills of research, court craft, advocacy, counselling skills, negotiations, and legal drafting skills. Understanding the market practice and the commercials around the transaction differentiates a regular lawyer from a sought-after lawyer. The Bar Council of India and UGC recognise the involvement of practising advocates and professionals in the teaching and learning process of law schools. Towards this end, UPES School of Law has a policy on the appointment of PoPs, which essentially is an engagement of senior practising advocates and eminent legal professionals. This is in line with international best practices followed by several top foreign universities and law schools.</p>
        <br>
        <p>UPES has a proven track record of placements with students working at global firms or studying at international institutions. NEST is a unique initiative for alumni who live and work around the world. UPES Alumni Team proudly supports nearly 22,000 UPES alumni who live and work around the world. The team and alumni volunteers help manage more than 10 UPES Alumni Regional Chapters that meet periodically for various events. Alumni are also welcomed back to the campus to mentor existing students, and as special guests on advisory boards and other committees.

            These initiatives, along with others, shape a learning environment that provides meaningful experiences for Gen Z learners. Our pursuit of excellence and commitment to creating path-breaking ideas in higher education is reflected in our new brand identity as a 'University of Tomorrow'. We aim to lead the way in transforming the education landscape and empowering students to become change bearers and boundary pushers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The university boasts of a robust and successful career services department. Its partnerships with industries ensure that the students have adequate exposure and get rapidly absorbed into professional roles upon completion of their studies. At UPES, the focus is on developing a world-class pool of young and talented professionals who are ready to hit the ground running in their respective fields. The learning environment and practical hands-on approach help students forge ahead on their chosen career paths with a positive attitude, the right skill set and practical know-how. Because of the relevant and ‘real world’ education and ‘on-the-job’ exposure, the industry-readiness of UPES students has been one of the key differentiators.</p>
        <br>
        <p>UPES Dehradun provides modern amenities with state-of-the-art infrastructure to its students. The campus is spread across 44 acres of land with domain-specific labs, hostels, and facilities for curricular and extra-curricular activities. There is a multipurpose playground for playing hockey, cricket, football, and other sports with world-class sports facilities and equipment.></p>
